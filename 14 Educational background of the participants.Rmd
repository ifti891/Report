Nomadic communities have a multiplicity of issues that lead to such a situation. Starting from the State's apathy, criminalization of a large chunk of Nomadic tribes, discrimination in the larger society, access to schools and the nature of the Nomadism itself. The Renke commission report also mentions the plight of DNT communities when it comes to education. In our survey, only 17% mentioned that ever attended the school. This is the situation of a place which is close to one of the biggest metropolises of India. We did not need to imagine on a larger scale the situation of those Nomadic communities living nearby small towns and outside of the villages or those who are on the constant move.

As Renke commission report 2008 states that "Schools are not an attraction to these communities. They do not relate themselves to the culture of the nomadic communities. Even if a school is available in the vicinity of the communities, they refrain from using it as it does not have any relevance to them. It cannot provide them with any means of livelihood, hence is not useful to them. The problem of the low incidence of enrolments and high dropout rates are related to the poor educational infrastructure, distance from the school facility, lack of hostel facilities, and the prevailing educational system." ([Renke 2008:88](about:blank)). Which increases the vulnerability to have access to other things including documents. Though it shy's away from mentioning discrimination and other biases having a big impact on access. It slightly touches on the historic marginalization of the nomadic communities. Which birthed out of the Caste system and later colonialism infused with the caste system.

"Education, by far, is a basic agent of change in the process of socio-economic development of disadvantaged groups. DNTs are no exception. While the Central Government launched its flagship programme of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) in 2001-02 for the whole of the country irrespective of caste or religion and the national rate of literacy is gradually inching up, it has not been able to make much headway for DNTs mainly for two reasons. One, there is not enough awareness for education among the DNTs living in far-flung areas and moving around the year from one place to the other in search of livelihood; and second, the children of these Tribes are looked at as additional hands for eking out a livelihood for the family. Thus, the rate of literacy among DNTs is much less than any other social segment of the population. It is, therefore, necessary that special efforts are made to undertake a massive awareness programme for DNTs to convince them to send their children to schools. girls' Though SSA also promotes education to eliminate gender disparities, the girls' position of education in DNTs is far too bad and special efforts are to be made to improve the situation."
