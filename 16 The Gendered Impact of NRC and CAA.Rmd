# **The Gendered Impact of NRC and CAA**

Perhaps the possible impact of the laws such as NRC/CAA will be worse on the Women's and LGBTQ community. One doesn't have to imagine much that who much such laws will have an adverse impact on the Nomadic women and LGBT community. Muslim nomadic communities are in even worse position. The problem starts with not having documents leading to further not having documents. Questions related to providing information pertaining to Family Tree is something which is always hard to obtain.

"As the Community Survey of the Commission reveals these communities have not received any benefits of government development programmes. The problem of the aged and that of destitute women is more alarming as they have not received the benefits of any governmental schemes like the old age pension. They also do not receive any financial assistance from any of the formal financial institutions. They continue to depend on moneylenders and from private sources and borrow almost on a daily basis to meet their subsistence on exorbitant rates of interest.

"Their women are not spared. They become easy victims of some of the lustful and corrupt personnel in the law enforcing machinery, and the land in the villages. Even children are not spared. The Community Survey clearly reflects the human rights violations and abuse of power by the police and others" ([Renke 2008:92](about:blank))

> Disha Pink Sheikh a transgender and an social activists says "People from transgender community leaves their parents' house in early age so they do not carry any proof of identity with regards to their biological parents. Even if they have so then after changing gender identity, they change their name so older identity proof and current identity does not match. Name, middle name, surname everything changes. They identify themselves with their Guru's name. So, during the process of NRC proving our gender identity will be a task. Even now when we go to Aadhaar Seva kendra even after requesting officials to put us in the gender category of others, they put us in male or female category. In Assam NRC more than 2000 people from transgender community were kept outside the list. Transgender people are Nomadic and they are landless as well. If they are staying somewhere on rent then also the owner does not give them any proof of residence. We always experience that the owner never allows us to use the postal address of the houses where we live on rent, for anything. From the procedure followed for NRC in Assam we can say that for NRC information related to biological families is considered valid, but we do not follow that system of family. Our family system is entirely different. Our family is not dependent on blood relation; we adopt each other orally, so we do not follow any documentation. Even if we do so and I will give my Guru's documents then also they will not consider those. According to CAA 2019 our government says it will give citizenship to Hindu's from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh but not to Muslim. Our country was under Mughal rule for long time and so our Hijra community came under influence of Islam, many among us follows Islam. Many among us follow sufism. Our names are also of mixed religion like mine Disha Pinky Sheikh so how will the government divide us on the basis of religion? Nomadic people also do not carry any caste certificate or certificate showing their religion. We orally pass on our culture and religion to the next generation.
>
> People from transgender community or Nomadic communities remain so busy in their struggle for livelihood that they rarely get time to apply for any certificates or documents. Only this year I got my ration card. Among 120 people in my family only 8 people have ration cards. People do not have bank accounts. Voter id, Aadhar card, ration card, PAn card or any other documents. Among 120 people only 13 have bank accounts. In Maharashtra where in Mumbai only our population is more than 50 thousand, among total population of transgender only 2000 people have voter id card till the date. That means huge number of people from transgender community do not have basic documents. They even fail to do railway reservation due to unavailability of identity proof documents.  So, we will be automatically thrown out of NRC.
>
> If we go to offices to apply for these documents' officials do not treat us with respect, their behaviour often hurts us mentally. If we go to apply for a caste certificate in Tehsil office the official harasses us to the extent that we leave those places without getting any documents done. NRC rules are themselves made out of the intention of hate towards people from certain religion, communities and caste. They want to treat this population as secondary citizens. They want to make us slaves.
>
> Till today we use form no 6 for applying for voter id card. Those who do not have residential address proof have to apply through this form. In these conditions how can the government even think about applying NRC? Do we have voter ids of 100% of the population of the country?
>
> Or Adhar card or Bank accounts? Answer is no. then what is the need of applying CAA or bringing NRC.
>
> How is this possible for people from Transgender communities or Nomadic communities to trace family tree? When we don't have any documents of our previous generations.
>
> Supreme court has recognized the identity of Transgender community as different gender in 2014, so how can we provide documents or any proof of our existence before 1971. "

> The Renke Commission report states that many women from nomadic and denotified communities are pushed into sex work. Since nomadic and denotified women are never included in any voter list, any government scheme or policy, especially the ones targeted towards 'women' could never reach them. The communities marked as 'ex-criminals' have had to face police brutality constantly. Through cruel violence and without following any legal procedures, too many innocent individuals have been thrown into prisons. In that, the trouble caused and torture carried out with women is the most inhumane.

While questioning this irresponsible behaviour of the government, **Shakeela**, a young social activist says, "The government is asking for proof dating back to the 1950s. My father was a nomadic person and he never had a single piece of paper to show the government. Does this mean that we came here from another country? It is the government's job to look for illegal immigrants, but why are the common citizens of this country being troubled for this? The government has historically kept our community away from the means of production. For example, they have brought a ban upon the sale of traditional herbal medicine and never made any other means of sustenance available to us. It seems like the government only has one objective - to trouble common citizens. They don't even give us the means to earn any sort of a living. They kept our ancestors in their prisons. To put it bluntly, only people belonging to upper castes would have documents dating back to 1950. What does this mean? That only the upper castes are citizens of this country and those decided to be 'lower' are not? I will not show the government a single piece of proof and neither will anyone else from my community. We reject this law. Nowhere in the Constitution does it say that we owe our personal details to anyone.

With 72%  never attended school and 40% don't know their place of birth and 43% don't know their date of birth. With almost no one having any document pertaining to the mentioned in the NRC Assam in List A and B both. The only documents are Aadhaar cards and Jan Dhan Yojna zero balance bank accounts. The struggle for documents goes even more weird when the government will allow Nomadic married women to produce the Documents asked in neither of list A or B. But have to prve with anyone of the documents mentioned separately. To produce a circle officer certificate and  Ration card is a game of mice and a Cate.

"BPL (Below Poverty Line) card is another handicap faced by the DNTs and without BPL cards, they are not able to qualify for the benefits of various welfare schemes meant for the weaker sections and the downtrodden. The State Governments may launch a special programme to have BPL cards issued to the eligible families belonging to DNTs." ([Renke 2008:117](about:blank))

"Similarly, a large number of DNT families are without Ration Cards which deprive them of the benefits of the Public Distribution System to purchase essential commodities at concessional rates from the Fair Price Shops. The Nomadic Tribes are the worst hit by this situation. Denotified Tribes, particularly Nomadic Tribes, are largely BPL population. It is, therefore, necessary that the States/UTs undertake the exercise of issuing Ration Cards to DNT families by organising a special campaign both for urban and rural areas."

> Professor Mosin of CSDS says
>
> Q. Statelessness- doubtful, tradition as oral- move from one place to another place, how to look at it then
>
> Disparate impact, this policy is discriminatory in effect, we do not how exactly NRIC and NPR will be implemented there are two different law one is citizenship act 1955 which was further amended and another is 2003 rules, NRIC is part of these rules, its not part of legislation
>
> NPR will be conducted first, which is the population register of residence and local bureaucrats will make this. People will be called in order to prove that they are residents. After that a consolidated list of NRIC will be made.(called as All India NRC popularly) do we know what kind of documents will be demanded, oral evidence will be accepted or not? We have only one example to look at is Assam, Nomadic is not major constituency in Assam, In Char area there is Bengali Muslim community practice nature enfored migration they leave in island in Brahmaputra, so when water rises they move to some other place, they do not have permanent address, extreme marginalization, low literacy rate.
>
> Another comparison you can do, women are actually a migrant community. After marrying at a very young age they migrate, rarely meet their parents if husband dies his family may not accept them. In NRC these two communities women and community from Char were adversely affected.  In Assam the process was very clear. It was monitored by the supreme court. But in NRIC nothing is clear. 
>
> So Nomadic communities will be definitely worse affected not only because they do not have documents but also because they are nomadic they do not have government recognized addresses, they are economically and politically backward. They are subjected to government capras, whim, discretion arbitrariness for them the process itself will be discriminatory. Policies itself are discriminatory. 
>
> Q. identification, local officers , legally identifying indian citizens
>
> Yes we have variations in documents, so we do not know what will be the impact as we do not know the procedure itself. This is an irresponsible act of the government; they have announced the process without clarifying the details. In Assam people are declared foreigner due to small-small variations in the documents. Foreigners tribunal cause act judicial body formed under 1964 tribunal order. The member of the tribunal decides if people are citizens or foreigner.Ria vergis, **Daksh foundation report s**ays small variations in spellings or date of birth led to declare a person as foreigner. India exclusion report shows the procedural violence while implementation of NRC. In Assam people who are kept out of the NRC are not provided with the reasons for the same, so we do not know the basis of exclusion from NRC.  Transgender, illegitimate children,property issues, variation in spellings and date of birth can be the reasons. Even in the translations from bengali to english,not even the contradiction but the usage of the name...if the same model is adopted in all India NRC then...\
> \
>
> Q. Discrimination at foreigner tribunal
>
> In the last 5-6 years in Assam the qualification of members of FT has been diluted to a large extent lawyers having less experience were appointed, retired civil servants were appointed as members so the people who do not have legal expertise were appointed so the process became bureaucratic. These members do not have the experience of how to look at the evidence, cross questioning, the significance of oral evidence. So the legal process became weak. These jobs are contractual and in order to extend contract performance audit is taken. If the government wants to extend the contract of only those who declare more foreigners than automatically FT members will do that. Earlier retired judges were appointed before 2013-14 during this time less number of population was declared foreigner as compared to last 5-6 years.  **Amnesty international report**
>
> People from marginal communities face the tribunal they get frightened due to various reasons like facing a big city for the first time, facing officers,inability to read the documents or participate in the reasoning of cross questioning due to language barrier. If the tribunal is not sensitive towards these things then it is obvious that people will be scared of the process as there are a number of examples in Assam. 
>
> Large number of population among nomadic is muslim in the areas like Jammu Kashmir, Himachal, uttarakhand, Kaccha Gujrat. And they are not having documents. 
>
> Q.Unrecognized communities, already invisible communities
>
> Cannot say. Already complicated legal processes which can be misused by local bureaucrats as they are given discretion,performance audit system, hatred towards particular communities all this will lead to a bad result. We can see this in Assam where border police misused their power, tribunal did not follow law, in few cases high court should have reversed the cases but that did not happen, then formation of detention centers. But the process regarding the NPR NRIC  is not declared yet so we cannot say. Transgender community- Swati Baruha, Current condition of Nomads in Jammu & Kashmir.

> "The NRC exercise in Assam demonstrates the process' failure to take into consideration the gendered nature of society in Assam, as well as the process' gendered impact. The disproportionate and pernicious effect of this process on women includes exposure to a much higher risk of being rendered stateless, and to their fates being left to the mercy of Foreigners Tribunals that are quasi-judicial bodies. In addition to remedying these gaps in Assam, New Delhi must take into account the lessons learnt if it envisions undertaking the NRC nation-wide"

"The Denotified and particularly the Nomadic Tribes are unable to exercise their right to vote as either they are ignorant or are on move from one place to the other and have not been included in the voters' list. It is also because these people may not have permanent residences. Steps need to be taken by the Union Government, the Election Commission of India, and the State Governments to undertake a special campaign for inclusion of their names in the voters' lists."
