# **Conclusion**

Film director Nagraj Manjule says in an interview,"I and many more like me are always in jail, and only the jailer changes. The identity of the jailer is of no consequence to us. My struggle is only to exit the jail." Similarly, the struggle of the nomads is not new even if the current jailer is new. In addition to that, this issue is being portrayed as Muslim issue. Even if the population of Muslim people in the country is 15%, the population of people belonging to nomadic and denotified communities too, even if not fully counted, can be said to be around 15%. This question then is not just a Muslim question, but smokescreen of it being so has been created in order to for the politics of the country and to coax citizens to fight amongst each other. Marginalized sections have been entirely ignored and their very existence in this country is being questioned.

According to me, the CAA, distinguishing between persons on the basis of religion, as per Bommai, is unconstitutional," former apex court judge V. Gopala Gowda (Jain, 2021; The Wire, 2020). Similar statements and opinions are constantly raised on the constitutionality of the NRC and CAA.
