Among the sample, Nathpanthi Davari Gosavi represents the highest numbers at 37% which is also the representative of Ambernath area. As the community is Maharashtrian itself it is expected that Davari Gosavi will be more in numbers. Mariaawale community makes up 19% of the sample but interestingly many of the other communities are not 'natively' form Maharashtra. For example, the Banjara community from Rajasthan makes up 15% of our sample. Raj Bharatri community originally from Uttar Pradesh and surrounding areas. While the Vadar community represents 12% of the sample.

What's surprising among the Nomadic communities is the diversity. Even in a small survey, we can see the highly diverse nomadic communities. Not just the customs but there is a great diversity of languages and cultures among the communities which they share collectively.

**The great diversity among the Nomadic communities is visible among the nomads.**
